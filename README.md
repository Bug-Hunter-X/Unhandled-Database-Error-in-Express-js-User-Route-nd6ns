This repo demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications:  unhandled errors during database interactions. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue lies in the lack of error handling for the database query, which can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior.  The solution includes comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage such situations, enhancing the application's robustness and providing informative responses to users.
